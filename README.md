🏡 Real Estate Database & SQL Queries
📌 Project Overview
This project involves designing a real estate database and performing SQL queries to address business-related questions. The goal was to structure spatial and sales data into a relational database and extract insights through SQL queries.

📂 Data & Database Structure
Data Dictionary: An Excel file defining tables, attributes, and relationships across spatial aspects (municipality, geography, land), including a lexicon for reference.
Relational Schema: A diagram connecting the four main tables, specifying primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships.
Source Tables (CSV):
Bien (Properties) – Contains listings with attributes (location, size, type, price).
Vente (Sales) – Records transactions including dates and sale prices.
Commune (Municipality) – Includes geographic and administrative data on towns.
Région (Region) – Defines broader territorial divisions for analysis.
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
MySQL Workbench (Database design & queries)
Excel (Data dictionary)
SQL (Queries & data retrieval)
🔍 Key Steps & Analysis
✔️ Database Design

Defined entity relationships, normalized data, and implemented foreign keys.
Imported structured tables into MySQL Workbench.
✔️ SQL Queries for Business Insights

Market trends: Identifying price fluctuations per region.
Property distribution: Number of listings by municipality and type.
Sales performance: Most expensive and least expensive properties.
Regional demand: Areas with the highest transaction volume.
Average price per m²: Calculating real estate valuation trends.
📈 Results & Insights
High-demand regions correspond to urban centers with rising property values.
Significant price variation across different property types and locations.
Sales cycles show seasonal trends influencing real estate transactions.
